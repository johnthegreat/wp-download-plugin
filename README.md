Download Plugin

This is a basic plugin that allows you to download other plugins from the server.
This may be useful if you want to download the source code for a plugin but don't have FTP access.

This is the first release and my first WordPress plugin. I'm pretty new to WordPress in general,
so please be gracious in feedback.

Comments, feedback, and pull requests are welcome.

Hope you enjoy this little plugin!
